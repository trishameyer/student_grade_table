        - Make sure the button has the same styling as the other two and fits in with the overall design
        - The button should say something along the lines of "Get data From Server"

    - Add a click handler to your newly created button
        - Using the LearningFuze SGT API pull records from the DB using an AJAX call
        - With the object you get back from the API find the proper data to add to your SGT
    - API URL: `s-apis.learningfuze.com/sgt/get`
        - input:
            api_key: (string) your api key
        - output:
            success: (boolean) whether the operation succeeded
            data: (array) every student available on the database
